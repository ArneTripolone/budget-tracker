# budget-tracker

## Description

This repo contains a budget tracking app. Users enter the name of a transaction, the amount of that transaction, and whether it is addition or subtraction from the funds. These transactions are appended below the input fields and a graph is rendered showing the various fluctuations in the account. An account total is also available in the header. This application is a PWA and can therefore be used in online and offline modes.
